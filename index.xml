      <description>Helen Wellons recently retired from her Senior Scientific Advisor role with ExxonMobil Research and Engineering Company after a 30-year career.
Helen, and her spouse Michael, joined Mobil in January, 1990 after receiving Ph.Ds. in Chemical Engineering from Purdue University. She started her career in the Pilot Plant Automation Group, developing supervisory control systems for pilot plants. She then worked in Applied Fluid Mechanics, designing cold flow experiments to develop models for lubes and hydroconversion processes and helped to build the organization’s early Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) capabilities to address refinery challenges.</description>

      <description>Dr. Sarah Wellons is a postdoctoral fellow at the Center for Interdisciplinary Exploration and Research in Astrophysics (CIERA) at Northwestern University. She earned her PhD in Astronomy and Astrophysics with a secondary field in Computational Science and Engineering from Harvard University in 2017. Dr. Wellons studies the physics of galaxy formation using massively parallel hydrodynamical cosmological simulations. Her work focuses on the most massive galaxies which formed in the first few billion years after the Big Bang, and on the physics of how star formation is regulated in such galaxies.</description>

      <description>I am a software engineer in the Scientific Solutions Group within Research Computing at Purdue University. My primary contribution is to the NSF-funded science gateway, GeoEDF, for managing, sharing, analyzing, and visualizing geospacial data. I have also worked in a facilitation roll in a research lab where I implemented and recommended standard practices, training research scientists, wrote workflow-enabling tools, and deployed complex UIs in Jupyter. I&amp;rsquo;m passionate about improving the state of science through sustainable software practices, the treatment of software as first-class research objects, improved institutional support for research software engineers, and diversity and inclusion.</description>
