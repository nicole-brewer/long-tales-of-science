Dr. Sarah Wellons is a postdoctoral fellow at the Center for Interdisciplinary Exploration and Research in Astrophysics (CIERA) at Northwestern University.  She earned her PhD in Astronomy and Astrophysics with a secondary field in Computational Science and Engineering from Harvard University in 2017.  Dr. Wellons studies the physics of galaxy formation using massively parallel hydrodynamical cosmological simulations.  Her work focuses on the most massive galaxies which formed in the first few billion years after the Big Bang, and on the physics of how star formation is regulated in such galaxies.

Galaxy formation is a highly complex process which links physics on very large scales - like the gravitational collapse of dark matter into the strands, nodes, and voids of the "cosmic web" - and physics on (astrophysically) small scales - like the release of thermal, mechanical, and radiative energy during supernova explosions.  Because this process is so multi-scale, numerical simulations of galaxy formation are very computationally expensive and require HPC resources to run.  Even the analysis of the simulation data typically occurs on HPC resources, as the memory requirements are too demanding for most non-HPC machines.
