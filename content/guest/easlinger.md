Elizabeth Aslinger completed her PhD in mathematical and computational psychology and MS in clinical psychology at Purdue University. As an undergraduate, she studied neurobiology and philosophy of science at Yale University, ultimately graduating with a BA in the interdisciplinary track of political science. After college, she worked as a learning center teacher and led psychoeducational groups in a psychiatric hospital while coauthoring a chapter about neuroscience methodology with Scott Lilienfeld at Emory. She later conducted research in personality pathology as a fellow in Aidan Wrightâ€™s lab at University of Pittsburgh. At Purdue, she has worked as an assessment clinician and taught the lab component of a PhD-level statistics course, which dovetailed with her research interests in psychiatric classification and statistical methodology. 

Her substantive projects have involved investigations of affective and interpersonal processes, narcissism, externalizing symptoms (e.g., alcohol use, hostility), PTSD, suicidality, cognitive neuroscience (in particular, learning and decision-making), and psychosis. Her broader research program revolves around developing mathematical models and computational tools (e.g., scientific software) for applications in scientific research broadly, and in psychology and neuroscience in particular.
