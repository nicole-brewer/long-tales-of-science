Helen Wellons recently retired from her Senior Scientific Advisor role with ExxonMobil Research and Engineering Company after a 30-year career. 

Helen, and her spouse Michael, joined Mobil in January, 1990 after receiving Ph.Ds. in Chemical Engineering from Purdue University. She started her career in the Pilot Plant Automation Group, developing supervisory control systems for pilot plants.  She then worked in Applied Fluid Mechanics, designing cold flow experiments to develop models for lubes and hydroconversion processes and helped to build the organization’s early Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) capabilities to address refinery challenges.
 
After the merger with Exxon, she spent a decade deploying ExxonMobil’s Compositional Modeling Platform in Real-Time Optimization (RTO) applications across refining and lubes processes.  These compositional RTO applications were broadly deployed across all of our refineries for which Helen was recognized with the EMRE Technology Award.
 
Leveraging her deep technical expertise and broad organization network, Helen took on a senior technical leadership role in the Compositional Modeling. Integrating across research, engineering, refining, and lubes organizations, she drove improvements in compositional models. When an analytical breakthrough enabled EMRE to be the first organization world-wide to quantify the composition of resid, Helen developed a strategy to extend the Compositional Modeling Platform to the bottom of the barrel. She led a cross-organizational team to provide ExxonMobil with a competitive advantage in making strategic resid disposition decisions across upstream, chemicals, lubes and refining value chains, earning her another EMRE Technology Award. The Heavy Oil Compositional Modeling Platform was a key enabler in accelerated development of recent heavy oil processes. 
 
In addition to her depth and breadth of technical expertise, Helen has spent significant effort in mentoring the next generation of compositional modelers that has provided ExxonMobil Research and Engineering with new capabilities in modeling heavy oil phase behavior, hydroconversion, and thermal conversion.  She was a member of the Process Technology Department and ExxonMobil Research and Engineering Senior Technical Councils.

During her 30-year career, Helen and Michael raised four daughters currently 21-31years of age, with careers in astrophysics, data science, mechanical engineering, and sociology.
