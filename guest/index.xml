      <description>Helen Wellons recently retired from her Senior Scientific Advisor role with ExxonMobil Research and Engineering Company after a 30-year career.
Helen, and her spouse Michael, joined Mobil in January, 1990 after receiving Ph.Ds. in Chemical Engineering from Purdue University. She started her career in the Pilot Plant Automation Group, developing supervisory control systems for pilot plants. She then worked in Applied Fluid Mechanics, designing cold flow experiments to develop models for lubes and hydroconversion processes and helped to build the organizationâ€™s early Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) capabilities to address refinery challenges.</description>

      <description>Dr. Sarah Wellons is a postdoctoral fellow at the Center for Interdisciplinary Exploration and Research in Astrophysics (CIERA) at Northwestern University. She earned her PhD in Astronomy and Astrophysics with a secondary field in Computational Science and Engineering from Harvard University in 2017. Dr. Wellons studies the physics of galaxy formation using massively parallel hydrodynamical cosmological simulations. Her work focuses on the most massive galaxies which formed in the first few billion years after the Big Bang, and on the physics of how star formation is regulated in such galaxies.</description>

      <description>Nancy has been at the San Diego Supercomputer Center since 1993, retiring in 2019 having held a variety of management positions. Nancy&amp;rsquo;s particular expertise is in the development of web interfaces to high performance computing systems, data collections, instruments and other resources fundamental to many of today&amp;rsquo;s research endeavors. Beginning with the National Science Foundation&amp;rsquo;s TeraGrid Science Gateways program in 2005, she has led many programs that support the democratization of access to high end resources.</description>
