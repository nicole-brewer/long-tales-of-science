      <description>I am a software engineer in the Scientific Solutions Group within Research Computing at Purdue University. My primary contribution is to the NSF-funded science gateway, GeoEDF, for managing, sharing, analyzing, and visualizing geospacial data. I have also worked in a facilitation roll in a research lab where I implemented and recommended standard practices, training research scientists, wrote workflow-enabling tools, and deployed complex UIs in Jupyter. I&amp;rsquo;m passionate about improving the state of science through sustainable software practices, the treatment of software as first-class research objects, improved institutional support for research software engineers, and diversity and inclusion.</description>
